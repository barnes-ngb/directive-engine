# [Your Name]
## Directive Engine: as-built deltas → installer-ready steps

I build tools that turn **as-built reality** (scan/field capture) into **clear, step-by-step installer directives**:
**move / rotate / index**, with visualization and a verification loop.

**Currently shipping:** [Directive Engine (demo)](/work/directive-engine)

---

## What I build
- **Directive generation**: convert nominal ↔ as-built deltas into actionable steps (with constraints + tolerances).
- **3D visualization**: web-based viewers that make adjustments legible and auditable.
- **Verification loop**: “before/after” deviation checks so teams can close the gap with confidence.

## Why it matters
Projects don’t fail because people can’t execute — they fail because corrections aren’t expressed in a format the field can actually perform.

My focus is making corrections **field-executable**:
- explicit coordinate frames
- constrained DOF (what’s allowed vs not)
- discrete rotation indexing where relevant
- step ordering + verification checkpoints
