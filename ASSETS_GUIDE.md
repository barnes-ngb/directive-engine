# Assets Guide (Zahner + past work)

This is practical guidance (not legal advice). When in doubt: **don’t publish it** or get written permission.

## Rule of thumb
If an image/diagram **was created as part of your job** or contains **client-specific/proprietary details**, assume it is **not yours to republish** without permission.

## Safe-to-use (usually)
- Screenshots you generate from **your own demo app** in this repo
- Diagrams you recreate yourself (e.g., “Scan → Align → Directive Cards → Verify”)
- Code snippets you wrote that are not under NDA and do not reveal internal IP
- Generic geometry examples (toy models), synthetic datasets

## Caution / often not safe without permission
- Copying (“snagging”) images directly from Zahner’s website
- Photos/renderings from internal decks, proposals, submittals, shop drawings
- Anything showing client names, project addresses, pricing, schedules, part numbers
- Anything that reveals vendor methods, fabrication sequences, or non-public tolerance details

## If you *want* to reference Zahner work anyway
Prefer these patterns:
1) **Link out** to a public page instead of embedding their images.
2) Use **your own diagrams** describing what you did (process + role), not proprietary visuals.
3) If you have public-facing slides that were already published publicly (conference/site),
   still confirm you’re allowed to republish and **strip sensitive content**.

## Redaction checklist
- Remove client names and logos
- Remove addresses / GPS / EXIF metadata
- Remove dimensions/tolerances that are not public
- Crop out internal UI tools / file paths / job numbers
- Replace “real model” with a toy model wherever possible

## Best practice for your portfolio
Make the flagship page mostly:
- your **demo video**
- your **screenshots**
- your **data contract**
- your **diagram**
with a small “Prior experience” section referencing employers/projects at a high level.

## Permission request template
“I’m building a personal portfolio to show my capabilities. Can I use 2–3 images from [public page / deck],
with attribution, and with client-sensitive details removed? If yes, do you have preferred credit language?”
