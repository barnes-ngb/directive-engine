# toy_facade_v1

Purpose: tiny dataset supporting:
- directive generation
- viewer listing + selection
- golden-test validation against expected directives

Notes:
- Part IDs should match your nominal model node IDs/names in the viewer.
- This dataset includes `nominal.json` so you can run the loop without a GLTF yet.
