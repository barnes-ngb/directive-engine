# Demo Script (60–90 seconds)

## 0–10s — Problem
“Reality capture can tell you something is off. The hard part is expressing the correction as a field-executable directive.”

## 10–25s — Load + identify deviation
- Load nominal + as-built dataset
- Show a part that’s out of tolerance

## 25–55s — Directive card + visualization
- Select the part
- Show directive card:
  - translate (x/y/z)
  - rotate/index (if applicable)
  - frame (site grid vs part frame)
  - tolerance + confidence
- Show gizmo/arrow visual

## 55–75s — Verification loop
- Apply directive (simulated)
- Show before/after deviation metric
- Mark as “closed within tolerance”

## 75–90s — Close
“This is the core directive engine. Same workflow can skin into construction install, industrial fit-up/rework, or metrology-driven correction.”
